# Computer Vision Projects



## Introduction

The main goal is to apply **Data Science Methodology** and mimic the business scenario I may face. You can observe stages of Data Science Methodology shown in the below image.

To achieve my main goal, I will act in dual roles: the Business Stakeholder who is expecting a successful solution to their business need, and the Data Scientist who is capable of delivering the solution by successfully passing each stage mentioned in the Data Science Methodology.

Below, you can find projects where I am mentioning the problem statement given by stakeholders, and the proposed solution is presented in the associated notebook for the project.

## Projects


### [Computer Vision with CCTV](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Computer-Vision-Projects/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%20with%20CCTV)

#### Problem Statement

We are a Surveillance and CCTV company. We have a standard CCTV system, and we want to upgrade it into smart CCTVs. We want a solution that enables our cameras to detect human patterns, count objects, provide analysis within a 24-hour cooldown, and correctly detect the proper alert action for the system.
