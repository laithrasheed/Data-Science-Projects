# Computer Vision with CCTV

## Problem Statement

We are a Surveillance and CCTV company. We have a standard CCTV system, and we want to upgrade it into smart CCTVs. We want a solution that enables our cameras to detect human patterns, count objects, provide analysis within a 24-hour cooldown, and correctly detect the proper alert action for the system.
