# Coursera Specialization - Leverage Data Science for a More Agile Supply Chain

There are two main references that documents learning journey throughout the specialization:
    - [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Supply%20Chains%20Domain%20Knowledge/Coursera%20Specialization%20-%20Leverage%20Data%20Science%20for%20a%20More%20Agile%20Supply%20Chain/Practical%20notes%20with%20numeric%20data.ipynb)
    - [Markdown File](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Supply%20Chains%20Domain%20Knowledge/Coursera%20Specialization%20-%20Leverage%20Data%20Science%20for%20a%20More%20Agile%20Supply%20Chain/Theory%20with%20my%20notes.md)


## Jupyter Notebook

### The following packages are being used:

```Python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm
import seaborn as sns
```



### The main points discussed in the notebook are as follows:**

#### Forecasting Methods

- Simple Moving Average
- Weighted Moving Average
- Exponential Smoothing

#### Inventory Management

- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
- Reorder Point (ROP)
- Safety Stock

#### Supply Chain Optimization

- Monte Carlo Simulation

### Outcomes

- The notebook contains functions used to calculate basic supply chain measures mentioned in the next section.
- Future work might align with automation, building databases, and conducting cost analysis.
- We might integrate automated dashboard using `dash` library, by building custom package that include helper functions used in the notebook.
- The level of the notebook is basic and introductory to integrating data science in the supply chain domain knowledge.
