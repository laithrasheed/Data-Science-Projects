# Demand Planning

## Define and Aggregate Relevant Data 

- Demand Planning: historical demand and determine future needs. Demand forecast
- The first step in demand planning is gathering relevant information.
- Stock-Keeping Units (SKUs) 
- The planner will need the historical order quantity information for all the SKUs aggregated to the monthly level
- We can forecast on weekly or even daily basis when dealing with products that are life-saving, require freshness, or have market or business specific constrains
Order history vs. shipment history. Cancellation is a challenge on both logs. 


## Identify Influencing Factors

- Obvious factors on increasing or decreasing demands, like holidays and general events
- Unpredictable factors / patterns may occur during unknown or unusual events, like COVID-19 pandemic. Are we able to predict such events ahead of time??
- Correlation and regression functions in Excel. Python!!

## Influencing Factors

- The video showed how to calculate the correlation between different categories.
- The video showed Regression analysis on Excel for sales value against 3 factors: SQFT, Bathrooms, and district..

I already performed many projects similar using Python and R. We call that in the context of ML Supervised Learning.
