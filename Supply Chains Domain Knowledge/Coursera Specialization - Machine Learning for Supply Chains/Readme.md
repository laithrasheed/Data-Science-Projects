# Machine Learning for Supply Chains

The notebook associated with this specialization contains the following sections:

1. Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Supply Chains
    - Utilizing `PuLP` Python package to solve complex supply chain problems.
    - The final project deals with a comprehensive supply chain dataset requiring defining multiple functions to optimize cost analysis.

2. Demand Forecasting Using Time Series
    - Utilizing `statsmodels` Python package where `AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)` model is used to predict GDP dependent variable in a non-seasonal dataset. 
    - Utilizing `statsmodels` Python package where `Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)` model is used to predict Number of Deliveries in a specific location as a dependent variable in a seasonal dataset.
