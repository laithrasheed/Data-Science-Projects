# Supply Chains Domain Knowledge

## Why Supply Chains as a Domain Knowledge?

The `Data Science Projects` repository is being created to reflect the period of time that I am seeking my role in the Data Science filed. I am being inspired from the interviews I had during that period, from January 2025 up to May 2025, where I had interviews in the following fields:
    - Neuromarketing
    - Banking
    - NLP using LLMs
    - Automobile and Price Prediction
    - Computer Vision in Surveillance and CCTVs

Each of the above industries required different specialized tech skills, where I have only general statistical driven skills more than AI architecture and software development, which that was mainly the reason beyond my rejection to my job application.

Until I had the opportunity to interview with a COO of a food industry startup. Where they want a production supervisor with ability to get involved in technology trends and AI data driven solutions in the **supply chains** industry.

Since I already **practiced** supply chains operations during when I used to work as a production engineer for around 1 year, then I noticed that I have the **Domain Knowledge** required to any Data Scientist that want to apply Data Science Methodology.

Starting from 26th of May 2025 I am developing this repository where I will apply Data Science on my experience in Supply Chains Operations aiming to land on hybrid role that combines both Data Science and Supply Chains operations.
